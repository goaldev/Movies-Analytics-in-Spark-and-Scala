# Description
Using Spark to answer Analytical questions on the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/) using RDD, Spark SQL and Spark Dataframes executed on Spark-Shell

## Environment
* Linux (Ubuntu 15.04)
* Hadoop 2.7.2
* Spark 2.0.2

## Analytical Queries
1. What are the top 10 most viewed movies?
2. What are the distinct list of genres available?
3. How many movies for each genre?
4. How many movies are starting with numbers or letters (Example: Starting with 1/2/3../A/B/C..Z)?

## Progress of Project
- [x] Download MovieLens dataset
- [x] Start doing Queries in Spark RDD
- [x] Write bash scripts to automate testing results
- [ ] Do More Queries
- [ ] Queries to be completed in
	- [ ] Spark RDD
	- [ ] Spark SQL
	- [ ] Spark DataFrames
